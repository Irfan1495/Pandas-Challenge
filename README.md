In this week's challenge I went through the district schools to analyize the data provided. I had to check the students' Math and Reading scores in different schools to analyze them. I will discuss two of the finding I had from this Analysis.

1. The larger the schools are, the less successful the students are. If there are over 2000 students in a school then the Overall percent passing is about 56% compare to a school with less than 1000 students having the Overall Percent Passing as high as 90%. It makes sense as teacher can give more time to each individual student if the class sizes are smaller.

2. One surprising finding that I saw is that the smaller per student budget in a school the more successful the students are. As we can see that the Percent Overall Passing for student with less than $584 budget is 90% cpmpared to school having Per Student Budget of over $645 to be only 54%. I could not make sense of this finding except I can assume that students with lesser budget might be focused compare to students in schools with higeher budgets.




Help:
I got help from the class notes and lectures. Danny helped me during the office hours before and after the class. I also collaborated with Anthony from class on some portions of the homework. Finally I got some codes from google.
